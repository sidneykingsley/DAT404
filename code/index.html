          <p>Callum is a musician in the London Area who I used to know through family friends. He approached me a year ago asking if I could create a website for him to expand his brand.</p>
          <p>Callum's industry is very social and therefore we agreed important for him for it to include plenty social links and updates as well as a photo gallery. I also realised after listening to some of his music in the design/concept stage that I wanted the website to appear playful and creative, mirroring the nature of his music due to the slight edge of it. I did this through the bright colour scheme and use of subtle animations such as the blur-clear hover on the homepage.</p>

      <h2 class="content-subtitle">This Website!</h2>
      <p>I designed and created this website from scratch, as I did Callum's, using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. As far as libraries go I used the inbuilt CSS3 'Grids' framework and one line of JQuery for the scrolling animation.</p>
      <p>I have also created other webpages to display my programs created in JavaScript, but they are in the <a href="#a-content" style="font-weight: bold">applications</a> section. I have created numerous additional websites throughout the years, but I haven't put these up on a server.</p>

          <p>In this assignment we were asked to create a fictional series of album covers for the band Muse's song "Uprising". In these designs I aimed to capture the emotive nature of the song; specifically, the anger portrayed and the energy evoked by the sense of 'revolution'.</p>
          <p>I used a combination of different techniques such as long-exposure photography and mixed-media. I also included painting, I did this in a style inspired by Pollock's drip painting; due to the emotional and chaotic nature of his paintings which I felt was mirrored in the song.</p>

          <p>I experimented a lot into typography throughout the years. Perhaps my most significant design, for me, would be the concrete letters I created for the Rosa Parks assignment (above). I also experimented with liquorish, nails and newspaper cuttings. </p>
          <p>I enjoy creating typography as it is a unique and powerful way to interact with the user and portray your message.</p>

          <h2 class="content-subtitle">Marine Weather</h2>
          <p>This is a web-based application I created using JavaScript and the .p5 library which took data from APIs and visualised it in an easy to read and aesthetically pleasing way. I hoped this program would communicate a lot of different data simply and easily; making it possible for use while on the water. </p>
          <p>I used an API key from worldweatheronline.com which has unfortunately run out as I was using an educational trial; this means I can't link the actual application, but I have included these screenshots. I also used Google's map API which, with some regex work, I was able to use to translate entered place names into coordinates (as required by the weather API).</p>
          <p>This was a very enjoyable project focused on UX/UI which gave me the opportunity to really try and cater to my perspective audience and practice my creativity in design and also add small playful touches. However, I ended up simplifying my designs a lot as you can see to increase functionality and fit into my time schedule. I also really enjoyed the mathematic side to the programming and the challenge of problem solving within it. </p>

          <p>This is a generative art program I wrote which uses algorithms to create an interactive work of art based on my chosen concept: sunset. This program uses one single rectangle and uses it to create at first a setting sun and then an eclipse with the option to add Perlin noise. It can either be let run or interacted with. I have added a link to it below:</p>

          <p>Aside of my JavaScript programming I studied .Net at college in Computer Science where I created a tenant to landlord interfacing system. This application used automated emails to transfer important messages from landlord to clients and vice versa as well as providing easily accessible information in a clear and user-friendly method. I came up with the concept, designed and coded this application myself as with all of the other programs mentioned.</p>

          <p> In this assignment we were asked to create a video or audio manipulation program in the node-based application Cycling 74's Max MSP. I created a function which took sound from the inbuilt microphone and decrypted it into frequency and volume values which I then scaled and used to manipulate a flock algorithm in reaction to the sound. I also used physical inputs from an Arduino with hacked added physical components to manipulate visual values of a live webcam.</p>

I over-contrasted all of these images during production, hoping to mirror great street photographers' style such as the infamous Vivian Maier.</p>
